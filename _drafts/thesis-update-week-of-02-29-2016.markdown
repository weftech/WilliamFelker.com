For this week I focused on creating a clear abstract and introduction. Along with listing some of the more interesting points which are included bellow in the resources section.

#Abstract

This project explores how K-12 students are taught to consume knowledge as well as how they actually consume knowledge. The changes in knowledge creation and dissemination, including the mass democratization of information, are directly impacting educational teaching methods, with educators asking whether current methods of teaching content knowledge remain relevant today. Stemming from this study will be the consideration of how the world’s content knowledge can be mapped and automatized into an assistive technology to allow teachers and students to spend more time with higher order creative and critical thinking.

#Introduction

For most of the world’s history knowledge equaled power. A moneyed, literate class of people within a given society typically maintained a monopoly on information. From the history of the Greeks to Victorian literature, a comparatively small segment of the population could access the kind of knowledge that was required for entry into a certain class of work and society. The advent of the internet over the past twenty years may be the greatest innovation in the democratization of information since Gutenberg’s printing press. With such open access to the sum total of human understanding, how much time must be spent in America’s classrooms teaching information that will be readily available to anyone with interest access? Memorizing historical dates, learning state capitals, singing the “president song” — should these become traditions of the past as time is instead spent on the critique and analysis of information to apply to our modern but challenged society?

As opposed to a lack of access the overabundance of information is actually becoming a challenge to education and true understanding. From an excess of "questionable" information to the omnipresent sharing of experience-based “knowledge” from people around the world, society and people have been saturated with data that cannot be fully processed let alone understood. The current data glut will only grow as more of the world’s seven billion inhabitants gain reliable internet access. As opposed to focusing on what to learn in a classroom, the question should be turned around to consider what shouldn’t be taught given limited time as well as how to efficiently process this ever-growing database of human history and knowledge.

In order to foster a society in which all people have the ability to effectively contribute and consume from the system as it continues to scale, we need to look at our educational system. An educational system which has not changed in decades and which still focuses on the importance of rote learning will not answer the above challenges. Often with a steadfast emphasis on statewide or national standardized exams, an overbearing commitment continues to the teaching of facts and answers rather than the critical thinking skills required for a global economy. If a job can be outsourced or automatized, it may indeed be; if an individual can create and bring new levels of understanding and analysis to a position, value is added. Ultimately we need our K-12 students, especially high school students, to see education as not the receipt of information but the opportunity to create and recreate knowledge in combination with an exploration and pursuit of their own passions. Ownership, creation, analysis, collaboration — these are the kinds of 21st century skills that students need.

Thus the question posed above takes on greater urgency. Assuming that humanity continues to evolve for the foreseeable future we need to study the best methods for consolidating facts and knowledge to teach the minimum viable quantity while pivoting to 21st century skills. Given the rate of technological advances, studying the creation of a program that would continually process new information and produce the critical 1% of content that will ground students in the history of the world could have great benefit to students, teachers, and society alike.
